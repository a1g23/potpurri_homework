// Write a function named setAlarm that has two arguments.

// The first argument: employed (the boolean true would be passed in as a parameter whenever you are employed)
// The second argument: vacationing (the boolean true would be passed in as a parameter whenever you are on vacation)
// The function should only return true if you are employed and not on vacation (because these are the circumstances 
//under which you need to set an alarm, of course!). It should return false otherwise.

setAlarm(true, true) // => returns false
setAlarm(false, false) // => returns false
setAlarm(false, true) // => returns false
setAlarm(true, false) // => returns true



// Write a function named oddNumberCount which receives one argument that should be a number. The function should return how many positive odd numbers there are below the number passed into the argument.

// Example expected output:

// for(i = 1; i < 7; i += 2) { // first can I write a loop that logs all odd numbers up to a point
//         console.log(i)
//     }

        values.push(i)                          // push the odd numbers into into it until the parameter via loop
    }
    console.log(values.length)                  // console.log the length of the array
}


oddNumberCount(7) // => returns 3 (because [1, 3, 5] are the positive odd numbers below 7)
oddNumberCount(16) // => returns 8 (because [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15] are the positive odd numbers below 




// Trolls are attacking your comment section! Let's neutralize the threat by removing all vowels from their comments. 
//That'll make them look real silly.

// Write a function named trollsBeGone which receives one argument that should be a sentence (a string). 
//The function should return a new string with all the vowels removed from the original string.

// Example expected output:

// first: what are my vowels "a, e, i, o, u" - 
// if I see a value in my string, I want to delete it from the output
// how to "scan" string (looking that up)

const trollsBeGone = (stringValue) => {
    let text = stringValue.toString()

    console.log(newText)
}

trollsBeGone("This website is for losers LOL") // => returns "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL"



// Make an object named bankInfo with your banking info that includes the keys listed below. Each key should have a number value that can either be negative or positive (e.g. -500 or 500)

// savings
// checking
// moneyMarket
// creditCard
// Write a function called bankAccountSummary that accepts your bankInfo object as an argument. The function should calculate the total of your bank account and return it.

const bankInfo = {
    savings: 600,
    checking: 800,
    moneyMarket: 200,
    creditCard: -2000,
}

const bankAccountSummary = (bankInfo) => {
    return bankInfo.savings + bankInfo.checking + bankInfo.moneyMarket + bankInfo.creditCard
}
// Example expected output:

// assume my bankInfo values are: 600, 800, 200, -2000

bankAccountSummary(bankInfo) // returns -400
console.log(
    bankAccountSummary(bankInfo)
)

const bankTotal = bankAccountSummary(bankInfo)

// Save your bankAccountSummary total to a variable called bankTotal

// Write another function called inTheRed that accepts your bank account summary total (number) as an argument. The function should return true if your total is less than 0, and false otherwise.

inTheRed

// Example expected output:

// assume my bank total is -400

inTheRed(bankTotal) // returns true
